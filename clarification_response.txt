The `backend/` folder at the **root of the repository** is the correct location for the FastAPI application, according to the `plan.md` (which is derived from the constitution and specs for this phase).

The `plan.md` explicitly defines the following structure at the repository root:

```
backend/
├── src/
│   ├── models/
│   ├── services/
│   └── api/
└── tests/

frontend/
├── src/
│   ├── components/
│   ├── pages/
│   └── services/
└── tests/
```

And the "Structure Decision" in `plan.md` states: "The `backend/` directory will contain the FastAPI application, and the `frontend/` directory will contain the Next.js application."

Therefore, the `backend/` folder under `phase2/` is not the one to be used for the current implementation of the full-stack web application.
